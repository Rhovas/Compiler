# Rhovas

Rhovas is a programming language for API design and enforcement. Using Rhovas,
developers can better express the contracts and intention of their code to help
create correct, maintainable software.

This repository is the compiler for Rhovas and contains the parser, an initial
interpreter, and the standard library.

Discussion on design, development, and other community aspects are all done in
the `#rhovas` channel on the <https://proglangdesign.net> discord.
